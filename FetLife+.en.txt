Improves the FetLife user interface.

* Add a Badge showing notification counts.
* Notification popups on messages etc.
* Bookmark system within FetLife.
* Highlight new feed items.
* Hide feed types on a per-user basis.
* Graphical navigation icons.
* Fix K&P navigation bar.
* Choose default target of the K&P link.
* Ability to block all content relating to blocked users.

This is a work in progress, so will be updated over time, please report any bugs to fix and ideas for me to add...

Please support FetLife too, which gives a full "gag" ability among other things (this will never replace that).
