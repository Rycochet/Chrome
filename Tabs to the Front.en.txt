Causes new tabs to be brought to the front when opened.

The standard behaviour of Chrome is to only open tabs to the front when pressing the Ctrl key - which is not an option for touch displays or people with physical disabilities. The Chrome devs have stated several times that they do not intend to change this.

Features

* Brings newly opened tabs in the front.
* Popup menu allows you to disable it for a period of time.
* Options page (using new Chrome v40 styles).
* Change the button between toggle state or popup menu.
* "Donation..." link can be hidden via the options page.
* "Options..." link can be disable via options page (you can still open it by right-clicking or on the Extensions page).
* A domain ignore list - if both tabs are on ignored domains then don't bring the new one to the front.
* Hotkey support to toggle state and toggle ignoring domain.
* Optionally hold the "Ctrl" key to disable (requires additional permissions).
* Locale support (translations welcome).
