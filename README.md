Chrome Extensions
=================

These are Javascript extensions for Chrome.

People can either install via the Chrome Web Store, or if working locally they can enable Developer Mode under the Extensions page and Add Unpacked Extension.

All source files are released under GPL, please contact me directly if you wish exceptions to this.

These extensions will never carry advertising, tracking or analytics code, do not bother contacting me if you wish to add it: in addition, as the copyright holder any attempted use of this code which adds any but does not add any major relevant features is expressly excluded from this GPL licensing and I withhold all rights (ie, you're not allowed to do it, and I'll happily go after you or your company if you try).
